# UAV Control Algorithms: Reinforcement Learning vs. Traditional Methods

## Project Overview

This project investigates the performance of reinforcement learning-based UAV control algorithms compared to traditional control methods. The implementation will utilize Python, MATLAB, and Simulink for simulation and analysis.

## Repository Structure

* /data - Datasets or logs from simulations

* /notebooks - Jupyter notebooks for analysis and testing

* /src - Python source code (reinforcement learning models, scripts)

* /simulations - Simulink models and MATLAB scripts

* /results - Experiment results, plots, and evaluations

* README.md - Project overview and setup instructions

* requirements.txt - Python dependencies (if applicable)

* .gitignore - Files to be ignored in version control

## Technologies Used

* Python

* MATLAB

* Simulink

## Getting Started

TBD - Instructions will be added as development progresses.
